Task 3
Design Section
When I did the design section it said there was an error and the error was that I had to change the name to untitled to Address book.py, after I corrected it, it worked fine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Enter a 10 digit number not a letter and it will find anything eg a book, it is like a barcode. The problems are that it only takes 11 digit numbers and doesnâ€™t take letters so that will be a problem to make.
